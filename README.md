Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard in PowerBI
Objective: Built an interactive dashboard to analyze heart disease clinical records and identify key health risk factors and survival patterns.
Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed raw patient records; created calculated columns and DAX measures for KPIs (survival rate, risk categories, and demographic breakdown).
Tools & Skills: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling, Data Visualization, Data Storytelling
The Purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create Step by Step Dynamic Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard Using PowerBI.
📌 KPI’s Overview : Survival Rate, Avg Age of Survival, Total Survival and Total Death Provide a comprehensive overview of patients.
📌 Survival Count And Average Serum Creatinine by age group Chart : Helps to identify patterns in patient outcomes. Showing how survival rates vary with age & how serum creatinine levels may correlated with those outcomes.
📌 Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group Chart : Visualize the heart function among survivor. We can better understand how heart perform varies with age.
📌 Survival Rate by Age Group Line Chart : Helps us observe how survival rates change with age and identifying age related risk patterns.
📌 Ribbon Chart : Visualize the impact of smoking, high blood pressere, diabetes and anaemia across different age groups. Ribbon sizes represent how these factors contribute to health risks at different ages.
📌 Slicer allows us to filter the data based on Sex.
